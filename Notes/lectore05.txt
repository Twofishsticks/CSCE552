2D game example part 01

game concept: single player 3d action singleplayer game 
NAME_ GAMETYPE using genres_ (make sure the entirety of the game is laid out in terms of what game each part is)

"One hit from the laser will destrpy an asteriod" - short, sweet, giga descriptive
    -   health, damage, % of each 
"Player has given amount of health that will decrease when they hit an asteriod" 
    - ambiguity with the damage 
        - make sure that this descriptor is working as intended 

"Player will survive set amount of time before they reach the planet" 

" game displays current time left and the health of the player" 

"The player can pause the game and resume during this part of the game"
    - giga important, pause = proffessional 
Save game 

After X, "the game switches to platformer"
    - assumption is that this is a pre-generated level 

Player has set amount of health is different from the space section
    - pretty important distinction
** it's ok to change the game a bit **

after full descritpion of each sectoin, label the total repetitions for each mode
Game features: main menu, pause menu

    C# looks like java + c++
    creating a new C# script in unity will create a class that inherits from MonoBehavior
