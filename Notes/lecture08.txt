3D basics! From this point on, it's all either 3D or various topics outside of 2d/basic game ideas 

vert, triangles, everything in between 
    - vertex : data for something (not just a position) 
        - pos vertex: single point in 3d space 
            - x,y,z (3D Vectors)
    - edge 
        - ordered set of of 2 verticies 
        - vector of vectors (point to [point) to point]
            - subtravt 2 vectors to get the edge 
    - triangle 
        - polygon of 3 edges, each edge has 1 vertex w another edge 
            - fundamental element of a 3d model (face) 
        - order needs to go c-clockwise in order to face cam 

    - face 
        - wither triangle or quads 
            - trangles are preferred 
                - GPU are optimized to handle them better 
                - easy to align 
        - Normal vect:
            - perp vactor to the surface 
                - cross product of 2 edges of a polygon 
                - it's what the 3d cam sees (no back)
    - Mesh 
        - collection of erethang that makes the 3d model 
            - sub mesh = surface
