game design

schema
    - representation of a plan/theory
        -Games specifically 
            - Cultural 
            - Play  
            - Rules
        - We're just focusing on play and rules
    
Rules Schema 
    - formal primary schema that focuses on the logic of the game 
        - facts/policy on how you interact w the game 
        - NOT the experience of the player
    - generally 
        - not what the player CAn do that makes it fun, it's what they can't do 
        - shared by everyone
        - binding
        - fixed and direct 
        - repeatable
    - 3 catagories 
        - Constituative - math part (points, damage, etc.)
            - Game logic 
            - Doesn't indicate how the player should enact the rules 
        - Operational 
            - Direct the player's behavior
            - Found in instructions
        - Implicit
            - "Unwritten" rules
                - behavior and ettiquete 
        - this gets wonky w digital games 
            - are the code constituitive or operations
                - it both dawg 

Games are a complex system
    --- fixed, periodic, complex, chaotic ---
    Games that lack complexity lack meaningful play 
        - complex systems allow for greater space of possibility (better play) 
    More rules != more complex 
        - complex possibilities are the result of a simple rule set 
    create rules, indirectly create experiences
    
    Uncertainty
        - if it's completely predictable it's poo poo garbage
        - Chance/Probability is OK
            - RNG 
        Risk is outcome w known Probability
        Games combine risk and reward 

    Information 
        -can be an economy because of it's value within the game 
        
        - perfect info is when eereone knows all knowledge in the game 
        - Imperfect info is when only some know about some
        4 types 
            - known to all 
            - Known to one 
            - Known by the game 
            - generated randomly 
    Conflict 
        - every game has some form of conflict 
            - yea, every game 
        - all games are competitive 
            - players struggle w each other, w the system 
        - all games are cooperative 
            - same deal 
        - win/loss conditions result from conflict 
        - ptw is technically a game design, in which the conflict "breaks the circle" 
Play Schema 
    play is an experimental primary schema in the games 
        - focuses on the experiences of the players 
        - Ludic activites 
            - non-game behaviors where participants are playing 
        - two types 
            - Paidia 
            - Ludis - rules 
        - 4 forms 
            - agon
            - alea
            - mimicry
                - be a char in the system 
            - roleplay
                - wierd sense where you're removed from reality
        - experienced through participation
            - books = read movies = watched games = played 
                (increasing levels of understanding in relation to interaction)
            - core mechanics 
                - collection of actions that are repeatable throughout the game 
    ___Flow___
    -- it is what it is, the "flow state"--
        - behavior theory 
        - reinforcement schedule 
            - rate that players recieve reward/punishment
        - Challenge shapes the player's experience
            - anxiety : Challenge > Skills 
            - Boredom: Skills < Challenge 
            - Flow is the between
    Narritive 
        - subsection of the story 
            - experience of the game 
                compesed of situation, char, and form 
            - Embedded narrative is the pre-generated components
            - Emergent narrative is created by the players through their interactions with the game 
                - "let me solo her"
            - Goals, conflict, uncertainty, core effects
                - narrative is used to ENHANCE the game 
            ludo narrative dissonance
                - 'hey this doesn't make any sense' : takes you out of the flow 
    Simulations 
        - all games simulate, not all simulations are gmaes 
            - simulate conflict in a few ways
                - territorial conflict
                - economic conflict 
                - Conflict > knowledge 
            - sims are abstract
                - how to use gaming tech to create sims
