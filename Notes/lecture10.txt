--Serious Games--
The majority of the class is in the "programming" section of game creation 

Now, it's time to look into the "design" part of game creation 

1938 "Homo Ludens" (concept of "play")
    - Play has 5 characteristsics 
        - Free = play, play = freedom 
        - ordinary life is seperate 
        - distinct from ordinary life 
        - order is created 
        - connected w no material intrest 
    - All of these are realyed in lecture 1 (basics of what a game is defined as)

1961 "Man, play, and Games" 
    - Play styles 
        - rules, no rules 
            - Ludus, Paidia
    - Play Forms 
        - Competition, chance, RP, perception disrupting
            - Agon, Alea, Mimicry, Ilinx'
        - Interaction with a system rather than getting "lost in the sauce" 

Serious games are Entertainment + _ 
    - Teaching, Training, Persuasion, etc. 
        - Used to convey a message
    - Focus less on the "play", moreso on the "engagement"

    - Clark Abt -> Serious Games 1970
        - Games teach, games train (Lecture 01)
            - Exploration of monopoly is detailed 
                - Higher purpose of showing capitalism in Monopoly 
            - Training is different
                - Need to know the actual steps to do X 
            
    - Persuasive Games -> Ian Bogost !!2007!! 
        - Coined the idea of persuasive games + procedural rhetoric 
            - PR: game communicates beyond graphics, story, and ANY asset 
                - THROUGH THE SYSTEM 
                    - Idea is the system provides an argument to the player 
                        - i.e. "second level": how everything interacts w others 
                    - These play onto the actions of the player as the "play" 
                        - Descisions, everything that's not truly "This does X, This does Y" is applied here
            - 9/12 Game Example
                - dealt w forign policy after 9/11 
                - scren is middle eastern village, crosshair in center 
                    - no how to, player plays 
                - Crosshair aims, click, shoot 
                    - people start attacking after shoot 
                        - Main idea is "no info, but you shoot even with human lives"
                            - even more in depth where lives aren't viewed as such (game) 
                            - Win = don't click/pull trigger 
        
    - Critical Play -> Mary Flanagan 
        - If you wanted a game to make sense, you need to make it in a specific way 
            - Details an "activist game" 
                - Essentially, the same as gthe normal game design loop, just more focus on the goals 
                    - Make the endgame (the ideas) a priority
                    - Things that don't adhere to the great idea create dissonance w the rest of the game flow 
    
    - Learn lang, dropped in the middle of nowhere (Train)
        - "Total Immersion" 
            - Price is right for english 
        - Context clues are the main way to do such 
            - Extend this idea into "serious games" 

    - Rehabilitation (retraining) 
        - Ephasiate 
            - condition w head trauma/stroke 
                - lost pathways that let people speak 
                    - melodic intramation training (MIT)
                        - Talking don't work, but sing do work! 
                            - After sing, work back into normal speech 
            - idea: match rythm game w therapy 
                - Experience this therapy in a GIGA low stress environment
        - Line up game with the values
    - Critical interactive 2012
        - Different games (ghost of the horseshoe)
            - What defines the line between a "game" and a narrative? 
                - real name is a "Critical Interactive" for narrative "games"`
