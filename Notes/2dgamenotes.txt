Vampire Survivors -esque game

    -- Name: Sk-etched

    Design notes
        - Chalk based 
            - gives E rating, plus leeway with sprite design 
                - Slingshot as weapon of choice 
                    - inf ammo
            - Variability with "monsters"/enemies
        - Arena
            - limited space to work with (i.e. the "chalk board")
            - allows for more limitations, "backing into corner" type stuff
            - Design-wise, limit is the edge of the board, background is the board space 
        - monster spawns 
            - outside of fov, link to camera 
                - variations on sprites = ways to fufil sound requirement 
        - Win/Loss
            - Win upon reaching time limit 
                - may alter to include inf time limit, scoreboard w best time 
            - Loss on no more life 
                - Life is in 3x
                    - Life loss upon taking damage from monster attacks 
        - Fun factor 
            - See success of 20 minuites, Vampire Survivor, ets 
            - Upgrades dropped from random monster deaths
                - dif powerup from dif monster (?)
                - Upgrades may be permanent or temporary based upon balancing
                    - i.e. shotgun, heal, AOE nuke, instakill, etc.
